[Last time]({% post_url 2017-04-23-sqlmap %}), we dumped the dvwa database, by exploiting an SQL injection in it.
Part of this dump, was the user passwords :smirk:

![hashcat](/img/posts/hashcat/hashcat.png)

These are not the user passwords themselves, but their [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) value.
In order to crack them, we need to know what we'll need to crack, so let's try to identify the cryptographic hash that was used to generate these digests:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
head -n 1 dvwa.hash | hash-identifier
</code></pre>

![hashcat](/img/posts/hashcat/hashcat-0.png)

Two possible hashes, but we'll start from MD5 since it's the most probably that's the one that was used.

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 dvwa.hash /usr/share/wordlists/sqlmap.txt
</code></pre>

![hashcat](/img/posts/hashcat/hashcat-1.png)

![hashcat](/img/posts/hashcat/hashcat-2.png)

And we've recovered the passwords:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03:abc123
8d3533d75ae2c3966d7e0d4fcc69216b:charley                  
0d107d09f5bbe40cade3de5c71e9e9b7:letmein                  
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99:password  
</code></pre>
